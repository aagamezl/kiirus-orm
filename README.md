# KiirusORM

Kiirus is a Node.js object-relational mapper (ORM) inspired by Laravel Eloquent. Kiirus is a translation of the magnificent ORM that is Laravel Eloquent.

Kiirus will try to have all the features that Eloquent has, except for those that, due to PHP to JavaScript incompatibilities, cannot be implemented.
